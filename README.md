# FYS-STK-4155-Project2

Here lies the code developed to compare feed forward neural networks to Ordinary least squares and linear regression. It's written in python 3 and you will need sklearn and numpy to run it.

## Structure
Each experiment lies in its own folder labeld after the experiment named continiousFunction, binaryClassification and multiclassClassification. The data folder contains datafiles used by the programs.

Important notice is that the ordinary least square fit is not included in this repo, but you can find it in a previous repo of mine on this link: https://github.com/hermanjd/FYS-STK-4155-Projectoppgaver/blob/main/Project1/Code/oppgave_b.py (The datapoints count was set to 1000 and noise set to 0 just like the feed forward neural networks)

The folder "trowAwayAttempts" is a collections of other experiments I've run, but is not part of the paper.

Feel free to contact me if the code is not running as expected or you need help understanding the repo.

## Acknowledgements 
I want to give a big thanks to Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça for making it intuiative to understand and implement the methods used in this project. A lot of code examples from their book "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python" was used in this project and because of this I've decided to credit them. I've also added the MIT licence in the NeuralNetFunctions.py file.
